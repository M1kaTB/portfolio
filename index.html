          <p class="about-text">
            Iâ€™m a developer who loves solving tricky problems just as much as
            bringing creative ideas to life. I enjoy diving into the details,
            making things work smoothly, and adding those extra touches that
            make a project feel special. For me, coding isnâ€™t just about getting
            something to work â€” itâ€™s about building something people enjoy
            using. Iâ€™m always curious, always learning, and always looking for
            new ways to create something both functional and fun.
