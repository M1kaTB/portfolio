            I built a fully functional music streaming platform Chakrulos where
            users can upload, play, and organize tracks. It features a custom
            responsive player, playlist management with JWT authentication, and
            Amazon S3 file storage. Everything from smooth playback to scalable
            backend APIs was designed to make the app feel polished and
            reliable.

            Created a game in 36 hours for my first-ever game jam, themed

            computer mouse) to move objects, solve puzzles, and reach legendary
            cheese. I designed the core mechanics, coded the entire game solo,
            and the project placed 2nd out of all entries, receiving strong
            feedback for creativity and execution.

            I'm a developer who loves solving tricky problems just as much as
            bringing creative ideas to life. I enjoy diving into the details,
            making things work smoothly, and adding those extra touches that
            make a project feel special. For me, coding isn't just about getting
            something to work ‚Äî it's about building something people enjoy
            using. I'm always curious, always learning, and always looking for
            new ways to create something both functional and fun.
